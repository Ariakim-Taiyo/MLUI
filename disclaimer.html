        <strong>3rd party vehicles are not the work of the author.</strong>  <br>
        They are provided by the author for use in the Geofs Multiliveries project by various contributors. <br>
        In order to create as much functionality for contributors and users, these 3rd party vehicles are capable of executing arbitrary code. <br>
        While there are are automatic and manual security and code verification measures in place, there is no guarantee that a vehicle's code will be fully secure. <br>
        In the event that a vehicle's code is found to be malicious, the addon developers will not be held responsible for any damages caused by the malicious code. <br>
        If you suspect that a vehicle's code is malicious, please report it to any of the developers listed in the credits and we will review it. <br>
        <br>
        For reference, here are all of the security measures taken to prevent malicious code from being executed: <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        1. The code may not contain any references to the userrecord, localStorage (and cookies), or sessionStorage objects. <br>
        2. The code may not contain any references to the window object. <br>
        3. The code may not contain any references to the document object. <br>
        4. The code may not contain any references to the navigator object. <br>
        5. The code may not make web requests. <br>
        6. The code may not call eval(). <br>
        7. The code may not call alert(), confirm(), or prompt(). <br>
        8. The code may not use the DOM. <br>
        9. The code may not be obfuscated, minified, or otherwise made unreadable. <br>
        10. All code is manually reviewed and verified by the author before being added. <br>
        11. Nobody may push updates to the vehicle database other than Ariakim or Spice9. <br>
